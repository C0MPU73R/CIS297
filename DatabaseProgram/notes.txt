//notes
// need tables to show
//monthly income amount, then where the income is actrually coming from
//such as career, investmets, interest on the invetments etc
 //FOR A SPECIFIED MONTH

//then under this, the monthly expenses for variouys items of the users choosing.
//some ideas are: 
Bills
Groceries
Mortgage
Credit cards
Gas
IRA
Laundry
Car loan
Utilities
Clothing
Daycare
Medical/Dental
Household repairs
Savings
Property taxes
Other
//FOR A SPECIFIED MONTH


//then at bottom can have income vs expenses chart
//monthly income vs monthly expenses, grand total amounts
//show difference



//TABLES: INCOME TABLE
//this is a simple table, need only the name of the type of income eg. investments, spouse's salary etc
//and the amount: lets say investments for this month gave us a grand total of $150, and spouses salary
//for this month was around 5 grand, (implying she probably makes around 60,000 a year)



// TABLES: EXPENSES TABLE
//very similar to the income table, but instead of gaining money, we are losing money
//example, lets say one of our category names (chosen by the user) was gas, and lets say that was $250 for this
//month 



//TODO: CHANGE GUI TO WELCOME AND SET UP USER FIRST BEFORE GOING STAIGHT TO MONTHS TO ADD STUFF	

//1. need to find a way to properly implement "goals",
//where goals are: Set goals by month for each category - allow the user to change this anytime.


//2. Transaction information: Transactions should be entered with Date, Category, Memo, amount, account
//need a transactions table that relates to each table or only the expenses table, is income technically
//a transaction? 



//3. "A running total of actual should be compared with the desired goal per month."
//this looks like where the "goal" comes into play
//email explanation from eric about what goal is: 'The goal is a given budget category for a given month"







//PLAN OR HOW EVERYTHING CONNECTS (HOW ALL TABLES SHOULD CONNECT)
//given a new member, we give them an account, which has various information about them
//this account table should then connect(somehow, foreign key maybe?/or primary? ) to the expenses
//and income tables where the expenses and income per month are entered by the user, 
//it, program then calculates some type of net gain/loss at the bottom, perhaps where it states
// income vs expenses, it then calculates if the member met their goal or not (***STILL NEEED TO ADD GOAL PORTION)
// behind the scenes, the system is also keeping track of all transactions (still need to figure out how to 
//properly implement this)



QUESTIONs/CONCERNS :>
//Does the user have to enter information for each "transaction" when they enter an amount for category
//either for income or expenses? 
//Confused on how transaction table comes into play
